# SortedSequence

Language: MASM

ObJective: 
Create a program that randomizes values of an array when given a certain max limit.

Design:
String variables are declared in order to serve as the prompt to be displayed to the screen.
Macros are used for displaying the array during each procedure state and displaying the prompts.
Irvine32 Library was used throuhout the program.

1. Procedure 1 serves as the assign values method that randomizes the values of the array and assigns them to each index. The values are randomized when the program is exited or restarted.
2. Procedure 2 focuses on using the bubble sort to sort the values in the array in an increasing way.
3. Procedure 3 implements the binary search in order to search the array for a value that the user inputs when prompted.
